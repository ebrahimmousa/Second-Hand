# Second-HandFashion Reborn - Second Hand
Fashion Reborn is an online platform designed to serve as a control panel for a second-hand shop.
It facilitates the management of sellers who consign their items for sale at the store, as well as the items themselves.

With this control panel, the admin has the ability to add sellers to the platform, providing the following information for each seller:

1-Name
2-Password
3-Phone number
4-Address
5-Email

Additionally, the admin can associate multiple items with each seller, specifying the following details for each item:

1-Name
2-Description
3-Price
4-The admin also has the authority to mark any item as sold at any given time.

Through this control panel, the admin gains access to various types of information about the shop, including:

1-A comprehensive list of all sellers
2-A complete inventory of all items in the shop, indicating which items are sold and which are still available
3-Detailed statistics for each seller, such as:
4-The number of items the seller currently has available for sale
5-The total number of items the seller has sold
6-The overall count of items the seller has registered
7-The total earnings the seller has generated from their sales

This project has been developed with the future in mind, as the underlying database records additional useful information for later use.
This includes timestamps for when each record was created and last updated, as well as information regarding the seller's login activity, such as the last login time and their current login status.
